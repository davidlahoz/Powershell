# Welcome to my Powershell scripts!

Those are my humble scripts done by myself to avoid repetitive tasks on my daily tasks as Windows Sysadmin.
Despite being a simple portfolio, I am also using this as a personal repo of those scripts, where I expect to be updated and improved by the time I become more efficient with PowerShell.


# Structure explanation

-  [UnifiedScript.ps1](UnifiedScript.ps1)
	>  All-in-one ps1 file including my scripts with a menu. Hardcoded.

-  ["\Scripts" folder](\scripts)
	>  Scripts as standalone. In a future I expect to link "UnifiedScript" to the scripts located in that folder to avoid double edditing and link it to UnifiedScript.
