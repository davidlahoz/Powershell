# Welcome to my Powershell scripts!

Those are my humble scripts done by myself to avoid repetitive tasks on my daily tasks as Windows Sysadmin.
Despite being a simple portfolio, I am also using this as a personal repo of those scripts, where I expect to be updated and improved by the time I become more efficient with PowerShell.

# Structure explanation

-  [UnifiedScript.ps1](UnifiedScript.ps1)
	>  All-in-one ps1 file including my scripts with a menu. Hardcoded. NOT UP TO DATE

-  ["\StandaloneScripts" folder](/StandaloneScripts/)
	>  Scripts as standalone. In a future I expect to link "UnifiedScript" to the scripts located in that folder to avoid double edditing and link it to UnifiedScript.

# To-Do list (not ordered by priority)

- [ ] Link scripts from UnifiedScript to the ones in \StandaloneScripts\
- [ ] Enable remote connection in order to avoid using local script execution 
- [ ] Better looking on all scripts (AIO menu and standalone)
- [ ] Add more scripts (expected not to be ever finished)
