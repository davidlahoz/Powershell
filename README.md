# Welcome to my Powershell scripts!

Those are my humble scripts done by myself to avoid repetitive tasks on my daily tasks as Windows Sysadmin.
Despite being a simple portfolio, I am also using this as a personal repo of those scripts, where I expect to be updated and improved by the time I become more efficient with PowerShell.

# To-Do list (not ordered by priority)

- [ ] Unify as AIO all \StandaloneScripts\
- [ ] Enable remote connection  in some scripts in order to avoid using local script execution 
- [ ] Add more scripts (expected not to be ever finished)
